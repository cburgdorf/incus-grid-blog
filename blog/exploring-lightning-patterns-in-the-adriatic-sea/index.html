However, anyone who has spent a summer in Croatia knows the other side of the coin: Sudden, violent thunderstorms (Neverins) are a real threat.<p>After a lightning strike hit right next to our boat in Greece, we built <strong>IncusGrid</strong> to stop guessing and start analyzing. We processed billions of historical data points combined with terrain topography to understand where the real risks lie.<p>Here is what the data tells us about the lightning season in the Adriatic.<h3 id=the-season-begins-june>The Season Begins: June</h3><p>While May and early June are generally considered safe, lightning activity starts to pick up by the end of June. Interestingly, this is mostly confined to the Northern Adriatic (Gulf of Trieste), while the south remains relatively calm.<figure class=figure><img alt="Lightning activity in June" loading=lazy src=/images/adriatic/june.png><figcaption>Lightning activity in June</figcaption></figure><h3 id=the-peak-july-local-variations>The Peak: July & Local Variations</h3><p>By July, the heat is on. The Gulf of Trieste turns purple on our heatmap. But look closer at the Croatian coast: There are notable local variations.<p>The regions around <strong>Senj, Novalja, and Split</strong> show significantly higher lightning density compared to the relatively calmer areas around <strong>Zadar and Šibenik</strong>.<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you seek calm nights in July, the data suggests the Zadar archipelago might be a statistically safer bet than the bustling (and electric) region around Split.<figure class=figure><img alt="Lightning activity in July" loading=lazy src=/images/adriatic/july.png><figcaption>Lightning activity in July</figcaption></figure><h3 id=the-contrast-the-ionian-sea>The Contrast: The Ionian Sea</h3><p>It is also interesting to zoom out. While the Northern Adriatic cooks, the Ionian Sea (south of Albania) remains surprisingly calm during July, making it a potentially safer alternative for those looking to avoid the peak thunderstorm season.<figure class=figure><img alt="Further south in the Ionian Sea: Barely any lightning activity in July" loading=lazy src=/images/adriatic/july_ionian.png><figcaption>Further south in the Ionian Sea: Barely any lightning activity in July</figcaption></figure><h3 id=high-season-august>High Season: August</h3><p>In August, the picture intensifies. The hotspot moves south. We see a new high-activity zone emerging from Makarska down to Zaljev Budima.<figure class=figure><img alt="Lightning activity in August" loading=lazy src=/images/adriatic/august.png><figcaption>Lightning activity in August</figcaption></figure><h3 id=finding-safety-the-power-of-terrain-shielding>Finding Safety: The Power of Terrain Shielding</h3><p>This is where route planning becomes crucial. Even in active zones, terrain matters.<p>Look at the islands of Lopud and Koločep near Dubrovnik. Using the <strong>IncusGrid Exposure Layer</strong>, we can identify the bay of <strong>Uvala Sunj</strong> as a statistically safer anchorage.<figure class=figure><img alt="Uvala Sunj: A statistically safer anchorage in August" loading=lazy src=/images/adriatic/exposure_safe_spot.png><figcaption>Uvala Sunj: A statistically safer anchorage in August</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Why?</strong> The brighter coloring in IncusGrid indicates strong <strong>terrain shielding</strong>. The steep hills surrounding the bay provide a theoretical "shadow zone" against lightning strikes, offering significantly better protection compared to bays with flat terrain.<h3 id=late-season-the-flip-september-november>Late Season: The Flip (September - November)</h3><p>As autumn approaches, the Ionian Sea wakes up. Activity increases around Corfu and Zakynthos.<p>By October and November, the pattern completely flips: The Adriatic becomes calm again, while the heavy lightning activity shifts south to Albania and Greece.<figure class=figure><img alt="November: The lightning activity shifts south" loading=lazy src=/images/adriatic/november.png><figcaption>November: The lightning activity shifts south</figcaption></figure><h3 id=plan-your-own-route>Plan your own route</h3><p>These are general seasonal trends, but every region is different.<p>Are you planning a charter or a cruise in the Adriatic? Don't rely on luck.
