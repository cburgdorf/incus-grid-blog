While we were very protected from the wind and waves, we experienced a lightning strike right next to our boat. It damaged our electronics and left us shaken.<p>Ever since, we've asked ourselves: What are our chances of being struck by lightning at this location? Would we be safer on the east side of the bay or on the west side? How much does the surrounding terrain protect us from lightning strikes?<h2 id=what-is-incusgrid>What is IncusGrid?</h2><p>Weather apps predict when a lightning storm is approaching. IncusGrid combines <em>historical data</em> with <em>local terrain features</em> to show you where you are statistically safest from lightning strikes.<p>Lightning strikes are chaotic and cannot be predicted with certainty. The lightning strike that hit the water next to our boat could have just as well hit our boat directly. Just like wearing a seatbelt doesn't guarantee survival but significantly improves your odds, choosing the right anchorage can reduce your lightning risk.<p>This might mean avoiding a specific region during a specific time of the year or choosing the side of a bay that is better protected by surrounding terrain. IncusGrid helps you make these decisions based on data.<h3 id=topography-analysis>Topography analysis</h3><p>When high buildings or technical facilities are built, a so-called <a href=https://axis-india.com/rolling-sphere-method/ rel=external>rolling sphere method</a> is often used to determine which parts of the building need additional lightning protection. Applying this method identifies areas that are naturally protected by surrounding terrain features.<p>IncusGrid applies a similar analysis to calculate how well terrain features protect different locations from lightning strikes.<p>We expose this analysis through our "Exposure" layer, which already covers most parts of the world.<figure class=figure><img alt="The exposure layer shows that the right side of the bay is better protected by surrounding terrain features." loading=lazy src=/images/exposure.webp><figcaption>The exposure layer shows that the right side of the bay is better protected by surrounding terrain features.</figcaption></figure><h3 id=historical-lightning-patterns>Historical lightning patterns</h3><p>In addition to terrain shielding, IncusGrid analyzes billions of historical lightning strikes captured by satellites over recent years. Our "Activity" layer shows the average lightning strikes per square kilometer for any given month or over the entire year. This layer helps identify how lightning activity varies throughout the year and across different regions.<figure class=figure><img alt="The activity layer shows a heatmap of average lightning strikes per square kilometer per month or over the entire year." loading=lazy src=/images/activity.webp><figcaption>The activity layer shows a heatmap of average lightning strikes per square kilometer per month or over the entire year.</figcaption></figure><h2 id=more-to-come>More to come</h2><p>IncusGrid is continuously evolving. We are working on integrating more satellite data sources to improve coverage and accuracy. We are also developing new features that visualize fascinating lightning data that traditional weather apps do not provide.<p>Looking back at that night in Igoumenitsa, IncusGrid now shows us that the southern shore would have offered better terrain shielding. We can't change the past, but we can make better decisions in the future.<p>Ready to explore lightning patterns in your cruising area? <a href=https://app.incusgrid.com rel=external>Open IncusGrid</a> and see for yourself.</div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=container><p>© 2026 IncusGrid. <a href=https://incusgrid.com>Back to main site</a></div></footer>
